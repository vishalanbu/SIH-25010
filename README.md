## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Solution: "BhoomiBandhu" — Your Farming Buddy with a Local Twist
Most small farmers don’t get good advice, and it’s hard to trust random tips. BhoomiBandhu is like a smart friend who knows your farm, your soil, and your weather. It gives easy, real-time advice on what to plant, how much fertilizer to use, and how to fight pests — all through simple voice messages in your language.

But here’s the cool part — farmers can also share their own tips and stories with others nearby, so everyone learns together. For those who don’t know much about smartphones, local helpers called “Kisan Mitras” help out with advice.

This way, BhoomiBandhu not only gives smart farming advice but also builds a strong farmer community. It’s like having your own expert and neighbors helping you grow better crops and make more money!

## Technical Approach
We will collect data from farmers about their soil, crop history, and pest problems through simple app inputs and photos. Real-time weather and market prices will be fetched from APIs.

AI models like Random Forest will analyze this data to recommend the best crops, fertilizer doses, and pest treatments. We will use image recognition to detect diseases from pictures.

The app will support local languages and voice commands to help farmers who can’t read well. It will work on basic smartphones and send alerts via SMS or WhatsApp too.

All heavy computations happen in the cloud, keeping the app light. Farmers’ feedback will help improve recommendations over time.

This approach makes smart farming affordable, accessible, and practical for small farmers.


## Feasibility and Viability
The tech needed for a smart crop advisory system is already available and affordable. Most farmers have basic smartphones and network access, so reaching them is possible. Using cloud AI and voice support solves literacy and device limits.

The system’s value is clear—better yields and lower costs motivate farmers to use it. Government and NGOs are likely to fund such solutions because they support sustainable farming and rural development.

With simple design and local partnerships, this idea can be put into practice successfully with good chances of lasting impact.


## Impact and Benefits
This system helps farmers grow better crops by giving easy, real-time advice on soil, pests, and weather. It lowers costs by reducing waste on fertilizers and pesticides. Early alerts prevent crop losses, and market info helps farmers get better prices.

It also supports eco-friendly farming, saving water and chemicals. Overall, it improves farmers’ income, productivity, and farming sustainability.
